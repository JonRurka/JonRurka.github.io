# About me

My name is Jon Rurka, and I'm an aspiring C# and .Net software developer. I started learning to write software over 5 years ago, and have dedicated nearly all my free time learning and improving my software development knowledge and skills. C# and .Net have been the primary language and framework I have used to program with from the very start. Although there is certainly more I have yet learn, I feel I have reached an overal level of mastery of C#. Through my experience developing games, game servers, and various utilities I have become comfortable with both object oriented programming techniques and component based programming techniques. Other than C#, I know many other languages and frameworks, including C/C++, Java, Lua, and web languages like Javascript and PHP, and will without hesitation use a languages and frameworks that differ from what I am use to.
